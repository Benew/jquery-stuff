h1. jQuery stuff

h4. A grabbag of plugins I've written over the years

This is a humble repository of jQuery plugins that I've written for our projects. These are usually small plugins (<75 sloc).

If you're to use any of these, I encourage you to just drop it into your project and maintain it yourself--I can't claim maintain these in a backward-compatible manner.

These plugins make great 'starting points' for whatever you'll need. Take them and modify them (or not) as you see fit.

h3. Superuseful

These things become useful in most sites/webapps I work on.
